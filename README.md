<!-- music visualized - the concept
    user searches youtube for a song. the song/lyrics/words to the video is then represented in some visual way using d3
    - graphing relationship of words (cant remember which one that was)
    - word cloud
    - regional words? on a map, see where certain words are used most frequently (would need another api)
    - some pretty art that's made from it somehow? p5.js would work  think. this videos would have it https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X
                            this one too https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a343yZ_JcPzIric4SOGqMZ

<!-- using react

    next is dropdown of what they want to see using the words of the video

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
